**Things to do to Brace UMD**
* Basic
  * Numerous unit tests
  * More examples
  * More code commenting
* Features
  * Log the type of definition used so that the run-time user can be made aware of unwanted definition types . E.g. If all nodejs modules are expected to use requirejs but one of them uses a commonjs require.
  * Enabling source maps to uglify may be warranted.
